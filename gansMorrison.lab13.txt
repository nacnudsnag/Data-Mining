Data Set 1

1. Effect of baseball statistics on Win-Loss Ratio of a baseball team

2. seanlahmann.com.baseball-archive/statistics

3. Examples: 996
Attributes: Various baseball team statistics such as Hits, Runs, Team ERA,
Bases on Balls. Likely 10-15 of these depending on how many we'd like to use.
Our class attribute would be the rank of the given season, which is a number
that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. 
Type of Data: ints
Missing Data: No missing values

4. The data set includes s large series of different team statistics that could
plausibly have an impact on the success of a team. We would then compare it to 
the success of a team (rank within a division at the end of a year). This would
be interesting because it is very real world, all the data exists, and as a
baseball fan, it is interesting.

5. It should be very easy to implement. All of the data is already there and is
in nice excel format with no missing data. The data is clearly meant to be used
for statistical learners. That said, I'm sure we'll run into some problems. (:

I think it is highly likely we will use this data set for project 2.

Data Set 2

1. Effect of economic policy on life expectancy

2. worldbank.org, more specifically the economic policy sections and life
 expectancy

3. Examples: 20, ideally
Attributes: 5 different economic indicators, and life expectancies for 
20 countries.
Type of data: Ints.
Missing data: Potentially there will be some, but we'll try to use countries
that have data for all of these attributes

4. This data set includes several different economic indicators from 20
different countries along with life expectancy. It is interesting because
it could be neat to see how these economic statistics correlate with life
expectancy

5. This could be really easy to do for project 2 because all of the pieces
of data are ints including the final class attribute. It would be very easy
to integrate with different methods. I don't see it being all that akward.
We would have to preprocess the class attributes to be in quintiles or 
something because otherwise you couldn't predict it very well.

Data Set 3: 

1. Effect of education parameters on income distribution

2. worldbank.org, more specifically the education sections and GINI index 
statistics to show income distribution.

3. Examples: 20
Attributes: 9 different education indicators, and GINI indices for 20 countries
Type of Data: Ints
Missing Data: Potentially there will be some, but we'll try to use countries
that have data for all of these attributes

4. This data set would include several diffferent economic indicators to get 
an idea of the education system of a country, and then see its effect on income
distribution. I think it would be intruiging to see the effect of education on
income distribution

5. This could be really easy to do for project 2 because all of the pieces
of data are ints including the final class attribute. It would be very easy
to integrate with different methods. I don't see it being all that akward.
We would have to preprocess the class attributes to be in quintiles or 
something because otherwise you couldn't predict it very well.

Data Set 4:

1. Effect of health on GDP

2. worldbank.org, more specifically the health sections and GDP index 
per capita statistics to show economic prosperity.

3. Examples: 20
Attributes: 14 different health indicators, and GDP indices for 20 countries
Type of Data: Ints
Missing Data: Potentially there will be some, but we'll try to use countries
that have data for all of these attributes

4. This data set would include several diffferent health indicators to get
an idea of the overall health of a country, and then see its effect on the GDP
per capita, or wealth of a country. I think it could be valuable to see the 
effect of health on wealth.

5. This could be really easy to do for project 2 because all of the pieces
of data are ints including the final class attribute. It would be very easy
to integrate with different methods. I don't see it being all that akward
except for initially combining all of the data.
We would have to preprocess the class attributes to be in quintiles or 
something because otherwise you couldn't predict it very well.

Data Set 5:

1. Effect of education on proportion of congressional seats held by women
at the highest level of government

2. worldbank.org, more specifically the education sections and the statistic
for the amount of seats held by women.  

3. Examples: 20
Attributes: 11 different education indicators, and proportion of seats held
by women for 20 countries
Type of Data: Ints
Missing Data: Potentially there will be some, but we'll try to use countries
that have data for all of these attributes

4. This data set would include several different education indicators to get
an idea of the education system of a country, and then see its effect on 
proportions of seats held by women in a country. This could give some semblance
of an idea of how education can effect gender equality.

5. This could be really easy to do for project 2 because all of the pieces
of data are ints including the final class attribute. It would be very easy
to integrate with different methods. I don't see it being all that akward
except for initially combining all of the data.
