For this assignment, we decided to use Baseball data to predict the success
of a baseball team. To do so, we look at 20 different attributes and how 
they affected the winning percentage of a team, categorized as high, medium
high, medium low, and low. To break it into these quantiles, we looked at the
median, and the first and third quartile. The non-class attributes range from
more obvious stuff like runs to less obvious independent variables like double
plays. Using these attributes we plan to use decision trees and neural nets to
determine the success of a baseball team.
