Guide to Files

project1.py
	This is the file with all the actual code. Here it runs several
	different classification methods on the same chunk of data, and
	prints relevant information including confusion matrices, p values,
	and accuracy scores. Additionally, it creates files with visualized
	confidence intervals to show the accuracy between five different
	cross validation tests. Those files are .png files found in the same
	directory

randomForests.png
	File displaying the confidence intervals of running a Random Forest
	on the example data.

NeuralNet.png
	File displaying the confidence intervals of running a Neural Net
	on the example data.

NearestNeighbors.png
	File displaying the confidence intervals of running Nearest Neighbors
	on the example data.

decisionTree.png
	File displaying the confidence intervals of running a Decision Tree
	on the example data.
