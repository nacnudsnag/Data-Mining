DT's Weaknesses
	"Greedy Approach"
	1. Local Decision on where to split is not a global decision
	2. Prone to overfitting data

Alternative:
	1. Make lots of trees
		To make different Trees
			Change data we build the tree with each time
			"Sampling with replacement"
			Make new Dataset sampling from the original
			Get same # of examples -> some duplicates/ some omitted
	2. Let these trees "Vote"
		"Voting" 
			simple: All trees and all data is one particular class
			trying again:
				for each data points(testing data)
				each tree puts that data into a class
				->but trees might disagree
			More Likely
				for a given tree, some probability of example belonging in one class or another
				Leaf nodes are not "pure"
			All probabilities are pooled through the voting press

When stuff is random <- like these forest splits -> should not do it just once
