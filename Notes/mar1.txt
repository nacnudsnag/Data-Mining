Inputs ->>>  |Model| ->>>> output

Neural Nets - Some General Structure

1. No hidden layers - attributes (numeric)
		Stores Numbers, Passes along signal, Signl is contained
	-> 0
	-> 0
	-> 0	->O ->>> Number Output
	-> 0
	-> 0
		Edges/arcs have a weight to show how important feature is.
This is the old method without hidden layers	


	Mathematically, often want the sum of values coming in to equal 1
	Range into node: [0 - 1]
	With binary Task
		output to be 1 or 0 - A step function
		   _____________ 1   Threshold that determines 0 or 1
