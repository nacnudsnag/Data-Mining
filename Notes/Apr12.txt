One hot encoding -> transofrm from one attribute to many
	Point: Get away from numeric values where order is not relevant
	eg. red -> 1, green -> 2, blue -> 3

Missing values
	sklearn imputer -> impute that missing value is the average across
	other examples
	-> Introduces a lot of noise
	Alternatively:
		1. Remove examples with missing values
		2. Remove the given attribute that has missing values
