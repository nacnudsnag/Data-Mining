Supervised Learning
	a.k.a. classification
	-> there is a distinguished "Class attribute"

Unsupervised Learning
	a.k.a. clustering
	-> not ONE special attribute

Question: How do data points "hang together"
	-> Use a model

Prediction: With a new example, what cluster does it fit best into?
	if we have "missing values", we could infer what the value might be
	Usually we just want to understand the natural groupings in the data
	Also can show which variables are most important/have the most bearing on a specific class

Cluster membership is usually probabilistic, not absolute
	eg. 75% one cluster, 25% another cluster
	-> lots of overlapping boundaries, can fall in multiple clusters, Fuzzye

In this, a class refers to a specific cluster

Basic Algorithm:
	Tell AC max # of clusters, eg. 5
	1. AC randomly divides data into 5 piles
	2. Create probabilistic description of each pile
	3. Take data out of piles (still have pile descriptions)
	4. put data into pile that best describes it
	5. repeat
	At some point data stops moving = done

	Repeat some # of times with different starting points -> repitition=try

Can end up with fewer piles, but not more 
Could potentially run multiple times with different piles

___________________________________________________________

"Bayesian"
	Takes initial distribution of the data into account
	When making probabilistic descriptions, it also gives each attribute a weight
		-> how important it is in defining cluster membership
	Bayesian statistics looks at the "prior" distributino of the data before clustering
		uses that distribution for the clustering process
