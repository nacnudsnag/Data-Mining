Processing

Curation - Process of collecting the data

1. Pre-Processiong
	One hot encoder
	Label encoder
	Missing values

2. Visualizing Data, to better understand where we're starting
	Where we're starting

3. Learning
	Methodology: explore variations
		-> Different Parameters	
		-> Different systems
	Questions: 
		Which way is "better"?
			Confidence intervals and P-Values
		->Prediction accuracy
		eg. DT might be "Better" because you can "see 
		the "decisions"

4. Post - Processing
	-> to better understand what happened
	eg question:
		Which examples came out "wrong"
		-> "Not categorized correctly"
	eg. are all the missclassified examples in the same class
		(is one harder to predict)
	See if there is a specific class that you should favor
		-> one class that it is okay to get wrong, 
		another that it isnt

	eg. are the same examples wrong across different
	approaches
		1. Error in the data
		2. Outliers
		3. Underrepresented in the data set
