K-Means clustering

Reminder:
	When "Clustering" we want to 
	a. Maximize differences between classes
	b. minimize differences within classes

K-Means Algorithm
	1. Number of clusters
	2. Pick N example at random
		define "centroid" of cluster
	3. Put others examples in cluster with the centroid they are closest to
	4. Redefine the centroid for each cluster	
		-> Now abstract point
	5. Repeat 3 (for all examples) and 4
		until data stops moving/clusters are fixed
