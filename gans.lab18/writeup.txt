Lab 18 Observations and Questions

1. This is really cool. I'm very surprised at how helpful this is and how 
simple the grid method is. It obviously takes a lot of time when a lot of
the computing space is being taken up, but it almost makes all the work
we did in the previous project obsolete. Honestly, I don't know if this 
counts as an observation, but despite the time it took, I thought this
was really really cool.

2. What I thought was interesting was that I had always assumed that adding
more hidden layers and nodes to those layers unilaterally made a model more
 efficient and accurate, however with the wine data, the layers that worked 
the best included 50 nodes whereas with the initial data, it worked best with
200, which was the maximum amount of nodes, and could have worked better with
even more nodes.

3. I'm curious if there's a way to visualize or see how more model parameters
interact with eachother. With just two, it was hard to see how different 
parameters influenced eachother. I think it could be neat to somehow show 
and visualize the accuracy of decision trees with variations between 3 pruning
parameters, and see how one of them can affect another. We were able to see 
this a bit in our project we did, but using this method, I'm sure you could
get an even more comprehensive view.
